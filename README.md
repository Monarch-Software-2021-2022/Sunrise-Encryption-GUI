## Summary
Sunrise Encryption is software written for the sole purpose of encrypting data. What makes Sunrise Encryption different from other software, is that we have a built in framework for plugins. So anyone can easily make their own plugins for encrypting data, and it will work automatically with the software. 

Sunrise Encryption supports both Windows and Linux operating systems.

## Advantages of Sunrise

With the support of plugins, you are able to create your own encryption types specifically suited to the users needs.

Espcially with the addition of Linux Suport, you are able to add arguments to your program, to specific types of encrypytion, plugins, and choosing the type of output. This would be especially useful for users who need choose to plug Sunrise Encryption in directly with another program.
